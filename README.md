Student Academic Performance Analysis
Student Academic Performance Analysis
This report summarizes the findings from a data analysis project investigating the academic performance of students based on various factors, including parental education, family structure, test preparation, birth order, lunch program participation, and transportation mode.

Key Findings:

Parental Education: Students with master's degrees as their highest parental education level achieved the highest average scores across all subjects (Math, Reading, Writing), while those with some high school education scored the lowest on average.
Test Preparation: Completing test preparation courses significantly increased average scores in all subjects compared to students who did not participate.
Birth Order: Firstborn children displayed slightly higher average scores in all subjects compared to non-firstborn children, suggesting a potential influence of birth order on academic performance.
Lunch Program: Students on the standard lunch program tended to have higher scores than those on the free/reduced lunch program.
Transportation: Students using private transportation showed slightly higher average scores compared to those using the school bus, but the difference was minimal.
Number of Siblings: The number of siblings did not exhibit a significant impact on students' scores across any subject.
Additional Observations:

The heatmap indicated a potential gender imbalance in the data, with seemingly more females than males included. However, the provided data did not explicitly confirm this observation.
The boxplots suggested lower overall scores in Math compared to Reading and Writing, with more outliers in the lower Math score range.
Conclusion:

This analysis reveals several factors potentially influencing student academic performance. Parental education level, test preparation participation, birth order, and lunch program participation all appear to be associated with score variations. Further investigation and analysis might be necessary to determine the underlying causes of these relationships and explore the influence of other potential factors not covered in this study.
